- 2.0.0-alpha
    - Fix: MultiplicativeGroupAlgebra.Negate now works correctly for all elements
        in the prime field, not only the subgroup.
    - Fix/Change: Removed CryptoGroupAlgebra.IsElement in favor of new IsPotentialElement
        and IsSafeElement methods.
        -- IsElement was supposed to admit only safe elements, which caused it
           to reject the neutral element, leading to potential failures during
           computation.
    - Change: Introduced generic type parameter for scalar types in major interfaces.
    - New: Added GenerateRandomElement to ICryptoGroupAlgebra interface.
    - New: Added SecurityLevel property to ICryptoGroupAlgebra and CryptoGroup.
