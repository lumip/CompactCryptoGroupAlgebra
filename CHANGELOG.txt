- 2.0.0-alpha
    - Added GenerateRandomElement to ICryptoGroupAlgebra interface.
    - Introduced generic type parameter for scalar types in major interfaces.
    - MultiplicativeGroupAlgebra.Negate now works correctly for all elements in the prime field, not only the subgroup.
    - Removed CryptoGroupAlgebra.IsElement in favor of new IsPotentialElement and IsSafeElement methods.
        -- IsElement was supposed to admit only safe elements, which caused it to reject the neutral element, leading to potential failures during computation.
